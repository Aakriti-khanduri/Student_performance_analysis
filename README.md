# Student_performance_analysis
## üìÅ Project Overview

This Excel-based project analyzes and visualizes student performance data, focusing on the influence of sleep, gender, mental health, parental education, part-time jobs, and extracurricular activities. It combines filtering, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and formula-based analysis to provide actionable insights.

## üõ† Tools & Features Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Charts & graphs (Column, Bar, Stacked)
  - **Conditional Formatting**:
    - Icon sets (e.g. arrows, checkmarks)
    - Data bars to visualize values (e.g. study hours, exam scores)
    - Color scales to highlight performance trends
  - Pivot Tables for summarization
  - Filtering with `SUBTOTAL`
  - Lookup functions like `XLOOKUP`, `VLOOKUP`
- **Dataset**
  - Realistic student data across multiple dimensions

## üß© Conditional Formatting

Applied conditional formatting to **enhance visual understanding** of data:

### ‚úÖ Icon Sets:
- Used to **highlight performance trends**, such as:
  - Green upward arrows for high exam scores
  - Red down arrows for poor sleep or study hours

### ‚úÖ Data Bars:
- Applied to columns like:
  - `Study Hours per Day`
  - `Netflix Hours`
  - `Exam Score`
- Helps compare individual student values at a glance

### ‚úÖ Color Scales:
- Used to grade:
  - **Attendance percentage**
  - **Mental health rating**
  - **Sleep hours**
- For example:
  - Green = high score
  - Yellow = average
  - Red = low score

## üìä Key Dashboard Insights

- **Good sleep** leads to higher exam scores and study hours
- **Females** tend to study more and have slightly better scores
- **High School-educated parents** linked to more mental health variation in students
- **Part-time job** holders may have slightly less sleep/study time
- **Extracurriculars** help boost mental health and exam performance
